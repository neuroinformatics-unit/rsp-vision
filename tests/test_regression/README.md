# Regression Tests
This directory contains regression tests for the `FrequencyResponsiveness` class. The purpose of these tests is to evaluate if the methods still function correctly. To achieve this, the new results are compared to a previously saved analysis output, which is stored as a pickle file in the `mock_data/` folder.

The term "mock data" or "simulated data" refers to data that is generated artificially for testing purposes. In this case, the data is generated by executing the `calculate_outputs.py` script. This script utilizes the methods in `tests/fixtures_helpers.py` to generate a `FrequencyResponsiveness` object. The fluorescence signal is generated from a Poisson distribution, using a specific list of seeds ([1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]) in the `make_random_responses` method. The remaining parameters of the simulated data are held constant and designed to maintain the logical structure of the data, considering the experimental setup. Additional information about these parameters can be found in the docstring of the `get_shared_variables_to_generate_mock_data` method.
